@yBASIC, pronounced "SnailBASIC" is a language subset for the 3DS interpreter [[http://smilebasic.com/en/][SmileBASIC]].

One problem people often have with BASIC dialects is that there are not enough punctuation characters.
@yBASIC attempts to remedy this.  In fact, the only alphanumeric characters used are those for "GOTO"

Note that live snails (@y) are not permitted in SnailBASIC: only deceased snails (@_) are valid.

@yBASIC can take no input, because snails are obstinate and don't care what you want them to do.

snailbasic.ps1 is an asspiler for @yBASIC.  Please submit issues as you encounter them.
